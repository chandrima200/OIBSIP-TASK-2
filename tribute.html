                <div>1921 – 1992</div>
                <div>The extraordinary man</div>
                
                <p>For decades now, Hollywood traditions have defined the making of films, but there have been many creative directors who have transcended the rigidities and made filmmaking an international phenomenon. One such director was late Satyajit Ray. Ray was a prolific writer, and the strength and distinction of his films derive from the screenplays he wrote himself. He had a reputation for being ingenuously creative within the limitations of modest budgets and scant equipments.His films are a rare blend of intellect and emotions. There is a precise studied control in his films, yet he succeeds in evoking deep emotional responses from his audience. Despite the acute sensitivity of his films, there is a noticeable lack of melodrama.</p>

            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p>Satyajit was born in Kolkata on May 2, 1921 to Sukumar Ray and Suprabha Ray. He hailed from a distinguished family of litterateurs, artists, musicians, physicians and scientists. He was nicknamed "Manik," meaning "jewel" in Bengali. His father passed away when he was only two and a half years old. His mother raised him as a single parent. They lived with his paternal uncles. As a young boy he had two interests - Western Classical music and watching Hollywood cinemas. These two passions proved to be quite instrumental for him when he chose to direct films.</p>

            <h2>Studies</h2>
            <p>He graduated from Ballygunge Government School. He pursued his honours in Economics from Presidency College. He then joined Kala Bhavan, the Art School at Santiniketan, Tagore's University, at the behest of his mother and Rabindranath Tagore, who was a friend of his father. At Santiniketan Satyajit Ray learned to draw from Nandalal Bose, a pioneer in art education in Modern India. Binode Behari Mukherjee was another teacher who made a lasting impression on Ray's mind. His natural talent in drawing helped him in his illustrations and graphic designs. However, Satyajit never completed his art course in Santiniketan but returned home. In Calcutta he would often go to the theater to watch Hollywood films that he had always enjoyed as an adolescent. He used to go to the theater with a note-book to watch as well as study the art of film making. Satyajit's apprenticeship in film-making started as a pleasurable self-pedagogy.</p>

                <h2>Film Career</h2>
                <p>Ray’s major films about Hindu orthodoxy and feudal values (and their potential clash with modern Western-inspired reforms) include Jalsaghar (1958; The Music Room), an impassioned evocation of a man’s obsession with music; Devi (1960; The Goddess), in which the obsession is with a girl’s divine incarnation; Sadgati (1981; Deliverance), a powerful indictment of caste; and Kanchenjungha (1962), Ray’s first original screenplay and first colour film, a subtle exploration of arranged marriage among wealthy, westernized Bengalis. Shatranj ke Khilari (1977; The Chess Players), Ray’s first film made in the Hindi language, with a comparatively large budget, is an even subtler probing of the impact of the West on India. Set in Lucknow in 1856, just before the Indian Mutiny, it depicts the downfall of the ruler Wajid Ali at the hands of the British with exquisite irony and pathos.</p>

                <h2>Work as a writer and illustrator</h2>
                <p>The motion-picture director also established a parallel career in Bengal as a writer and an illustrator, chiefly for young people. He revived the children’s magazine Sandesh (which his grandfather had started in 1913) and edited it until his death in 1992. Ray was the author of numerous short stories and novellas, and in fact writing, rather than filmmaking, became his main source of income. His stories have been translated and published in Europe, the United States, and elsewhere. Some of Ray’s writings on cinema are collected in Our Films, Their Films (1976). His other works include the memoir Yakhana chota chilama (1982; Childhood Days).</p>

                <h2>Directing</h2>
                <p>directing, the craft of controlling the evolution of a performance out of material composed or assembled by an author. The performance may be live, as in a theatre and in some broadcasts, or it may be recorded, as in motion pictures and the majority of broadcast material. The term is also used in film, television, video, and radio to describe the shaping of material that may not involve actors and may be no more than a collection of visual or aural images.In the theatre there was for a time a confusion of terminology between British usage and that of the United States. The director (as distinct from an old-time actor organizing rehearsals of a play in which he himself appears) emerged during the 19th century, and, like his actors, he worked for an employer who engaged both on contract. The employer, in Britain, came to be known as the manager, while the person directing the action was known as the producer. In the United States the producer has always been the one who engages the actors and finances the production, while the artist who directs the actors and shapes the performance is known as the director. With the advent of films these terms were applied to the new industry, and the American usage eventually found its way into the London theatre. It has since been absorbed by British broadcasting and British regional theatres as well and is now applied generally, although the original British usage is found in many earlier books.</p>
